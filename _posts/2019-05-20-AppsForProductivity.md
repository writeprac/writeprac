## Productivity

   You get home from school/work, an assignment due the next day. Deciding to be productive, you begin working on it right away. Five minutes in, your work slows and you consider taking a short break.     
   *I'll just check my instagram, it'll take max. 5 minutes* you think to yourself as you open the app. You scroll down your feed and check the explore page, enjoying yourself. "Five minutes later", you check the time---30 minutes have passed.      
   *Oh no!* you think to yourself, *how did this happen?*.

   
   Everybody has experienced this at least once, where you lost tack of time and before you know it, an hour has passed. I, personally, have really struggled with being productive, as I am a heavy procrastinator and struggle staying on task. To help with this, I use two apps that have helped me stay on task, and remember my assignments.
    
## 1) [Trello](https://trello.com/en)

   Everyone needs a todo list. Not only will they help you remember what your tasks are, but will also help you prioritize. I use trello because it has a very user-friendly interface and allows you to categorize your tasks.

  Trello is not only available as a mobile app, but also as a web app. Meaning your todo lists can be viewed and edited from not only your phone, but also your PC/laptop.
    
## 2) [Discord](https://https://discordapp.com/)

   This may seem counter productive, as Discord notifications may be distracting (they can be disabled). However, Discord is a great way to send messages to friends/co-workers and for coordinating large (and small) projects, as it allows private servers with text and video chat. Although Discord is commonly referred to as an app for "gamers", it can be useful for many other things.

   A popular alternative to Discord is [Slack](https://slack.com). Although they have some differences, apps like Slack and Discord are a great way to be more productive, and are a great alternative to any online chatrooms/group video-call programs. Both Discord and Slack offer mobile and web platforms of their service, allowing you to communicate using your PC, phone, or laptop.
