## About Me
* I'm a student who really loves writing.
* I've always wanted to have a personal blog, but i've never had the courage to reveal myself to others online.
* I enjoy drawing (mostly digital), music production, and computer programming (weird mix huh?).

## Guest Posts

* Please email the final version of your blog post to me.
* Please refrain from anything political or highly controversial topics.
* You will receive credit for any guest posts.

## Contact

At the moment, I will only be reachable through email, github, and insta. I may decide to add other contact options in the future! :)
